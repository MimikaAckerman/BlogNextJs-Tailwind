Tokyo Ghoul (東京喰種トーキョーグール, Tōkyō Gūru?) is the anime adaptation produced by Studio Pierrot based on the manga of the same name, which premiered in Japan on July 4, 2014 and ran for 12 episodes.

A sequel titled Tokyo Ghoul √A (東京喰種トーキョーグール√A, Tōkyō Gūru √A?) was released in Japan on January 9, 2015 and featured 12 episodes. This sequel is characterized by possessing its own storyline, which unlike the first season, was not based on the manga.

On October 5, 2017, an adaptation of the Tokyo Ghoul:re manga was announced, although the broadcasting date and duration are currently unknown. 

## Argument

Strange murders are occurring one after another in Tokyo. Due to evidence found at the scenes, the police conclude that the attacks are the work of Ghouls which are living beings that feed on human flesh. Kaneki and Hide, two childhood friends who go to Kamii University, meet in a cafe wondering what Ghouls are and what they look like, after a while they come to the conclusion that they may be hiding behind a human appearance.

That day Kaneki meets the girl he is attracted to, and finally manages to arrange a date with her; but after accompanying her all day and arriving to a desolate place in the city, it is revealed that the girl is a Ghoul and intends to devour Kaneki; who suffers several stab wounds but survives because he had a kidney transplant from Rize, who died thanks to some beams that fell on him by accident. But now Kaneki discovers that he has Ghoul blood in his body, and from that moment on he will have to eat human flesh if he wants to survive.
